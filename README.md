# Storage pods
The planetary scale storage grid will be powered by small computers (Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi, Pine64, etc.) attached to massive external storage (1TB, 2TB, more) that are located in people's homes all over the planet. We'd like to see someone purchase it, plug it into power and a router, and forget about it. This repo tracks the evolution of the device.
