# Our Data Our Hands
We run the global network storage grid that allows you to contribute to safeguarding humanity's data.

The planetary scale storage grid will be powered by small computers attached to massive external storage that are located in people's homes all over the planet. We'd like to see someone purchase it, plug it into power and a router, and forget about it. This repo tracks the evolution of the device.

# The storage pods
The v1 version of hardware is:
* 1 x Raspberry Pi 3 Model B
* 1 x Raspberry Pi 3 Case
* 1 x set of heat sinks
* 1 x 2.5A power supply for Raspberry Pi 3
* 1 x 8GB/16GB/32GB Micro SD card
* 1 x 5TB Seagate USB External HDD
* 1 x 5ft Ethernet cable
